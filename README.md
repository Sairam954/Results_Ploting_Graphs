# Results_Ploting_Graphs
This repository contains the python code for producing the results graphs for my conference/journal papers. This contains different kinds of graphs used in my research, I want to make the code generic that anyone can use it.
All the charts are plotted using matplotlib library
1. Barchart.py - This has lot of custom things which you may need while plotting in your chart, some of the them are:
   -> stacked bar chart \n
   -> custom fonts and style \n
   -> configuration legends location \n
   -> custom plot colors \n
   -> Providing location of x and y labels \n 
   -> Removing X and Y ticks for the graph
