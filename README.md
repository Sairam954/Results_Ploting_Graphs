# Results_Ploting_Graphs
This repository contains the python code for producing the results graphs for my conference/journal papers. This contains different kinds of graphs used in my research, I want to make the code generic that anyone can use it.
All the charts are plotted using matplotlib library
1. Barchart.py - This customization which you often need while plotting in your chart, some of the them are:
   -> stacked bar chart 
   -> custom fonts and style 
   -> configuration legends location 
   -> custom plot colors 
   -> Providing location of x and y labels 
   -> Removing X and Y ticks for the graph
